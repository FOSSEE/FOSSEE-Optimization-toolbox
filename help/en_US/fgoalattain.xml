   <para>
fgoalattain solves the goal attainment problem, which is one formulation for minimizing a multiobjective optimization problem.
Finds the minimum of a problem specified by:
   </para>
   <para>
Minimise Y such that
   </para>
   <para>
<latex>
\begin{eqnarray}
\mbox{min}_{x,\gamma}  &amp; f(x)-weight \ast \gamma \leq goal \\
\mbox{subject to} &amp; c(x) \leq 0 \\
&amp; c_{eq}(x) = 0 \\
&amp; Ax \leq b \\
&amp; A_{eq} x = b_{eq} \\
&amp; lb \leq x \leq ub
\end{eqnarray}

   <para>
The solver makes use of fmincon to find the minimum.
The objective function must have header :
<programlisting>
f = objfun ( x )
</programlisting>
where x is a n x 1 matrix of doubles and f is a m x 1 matrix of doubles, where m is the number of objectives
On input, the variable x contains the current point and, on output,
the variable f must contain the objective function values.
By default, the fgoalattain uses the method of finite differences to comput the gradient of the objectives
   </para>
   <para>
In order to use exact gradients, we must update the header of the
objective function to :
<programlisting>
[f,G] = objfungrad ( x )
</programlisting>
where x is a n x 1 matrix of doubles, f is a 1 x 1 matrix of doubles
and G is a n x 1 matrix of doubles.
   </para>
   <para>
On input, the variable x contains the current point and, on output,
the variable f must contain the objective function value and the variable
G must contain the gradient of the objective function.
Furthermore, we must enable the "GradObj" option with the statement similar to :
options=list("GradObj", "ON");
This will let fmincon know that the exact gradient of the objective
function is known, so that it can change the calling sequence to the
objective function.
   </para>
   <para>
The constraint function must have header :
<programlisting>
[c, ceq] = confun(x)
</programlisting>
where x is a n x 1 matrix of doubles, c is a nni x 1 matrix of doubles and
ceq is a nne x 1 matrix of doubles (nni : number of nonlinear inequality
constraints, nne : number of nonlinear equality constraints).
On input, the variable x contains the current point and, on output,
the variable c must contain the nonlinear inequality constraints and ceq must contain the
nonlinear equality constraints.
   </para>
   <para>
By default, the gradient of the constraints is computed using the method of finite differences
If exact gradients can be computed, we need to update the header to
<programlisting>
[c,ceq,DC,DCeq] = confungrad(x)
</programlisting>
where x is a n x 1 matrix of doubles, c is a nni x 1 matrix of doubles,
ceq is a nne x 1 matrix of doubles, DC is a n x nni matrix of doubles and
DCeq is a n x nne matrix of doubles.
On input, the variable x contains the current point and, on output,
the variable c must contain the nonlinear inequality constraint function value,
the variable ceq must contain the nonlinear equality constraint function value,
the variable DC must contain the Jacobian matrix of the nonlinear inequality constraints
and the variable DCeq must contain the Jacobian matrix of the nonlinear equality constraints.
The i-th nonlinear inequality constraint is associated to the i-th column of
the matrix DC, i.e, it is stored in DC(:,i) (same for DCeq).
Furthermore, we must enable the "GradObj" option with the statement similar to:
<programlisting>
options=list("GradObj", "ON","GradCon", "ON");
</programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>
The fgoalattain finds out the maximum value of Y for the objectives evaluated at the starting point and
adds that as another variable to the vector x
This is passed to the fmincon function to get the optimised value of Y
Hence, the algorithm used mainly is "ipopt" to obtain the optimum solution
The relations between f(x), Y, weights and goals are added as additional non-linear inequality constraints
   </para>
   <para>
The output exitflag is explained below:
0: "Optimal Solution Found."
1: "Maximum Number of Iterations Exceeded. Output may not be optimal."
2: "Maximum CPU Time exceeded. Output may not be optimal."
3: "Stop at Tiny Step"
4: "Solved To Acceptable Level"
5: "Converged to a point of local infeasibility."
6: "Stopping optimization at current point as requested by user."
7: "Feasible point for square problem found."
8: "Iterates diverging; problem might be unbounded."
9: "Restoration Failed!"
10:"Error in step computation (regularization becomes too large?)!"
11: "Problem has too few degrees of freedom."
12: "Invalid option thrown back by IPOpt"
13: "Not enough memory."
15: "INTERNAL ERROR: Unknown SolverReturn value - Notify IPOPT Authors."
